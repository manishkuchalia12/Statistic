    "Ans:-A Venn diagram is a visual representation that illustrates the relationships and commonalities between different sets or groups. It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes, each representing a set, and the overlapping areas represent the elements that belong to more than one set. Venn diagrams are widely used in mathematics, logic, statistics, and other fields to show the logical relationships between sets."

In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the left and right sides of the distribution are mirror images of each other. However, in skewed distributions, the tails (the portions of the distribution at the extremes) may be stretched or skewed to one side."
